# LED-with-Brightness-Condition

## Contextualization
In this experiment, we have an LED controlled by digital pin 13 turn on when the ambient brightness drops below 85 units on the LDR (Light Dependent Resistor). Otherwise, the LED should be turned off. The LDR will be connected to analog pin 0 for reading units, and the power for the LDR will come from the 5Volts pin.

## Components:
- 1 - Arduino Uno R3
- 1 - 220 Ω Resistors
- 1 - 10 KΩ Resistors
- 1 - Protoboard
- 7 - Jumpers(male-to-male)
- 1 - Photoresistor
- 1 - USB Cable 
- 1 - LED
